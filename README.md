# Python Pokemon DATA
Website api pokemon: https://pokeapi.co 

For my Pokédex Flutter project, I needed data from the pokémon api. But it took too many requests to get what I needed. These scripts allow me to retrieve the data in a simpler format.
- script.py = Retrieves the 151 pokémons from the first generation
- script_one.py = Retrieves 1 selected pokémon (example: id = 6 Charizard)

Look the official API, and update Object Poke with needed data.
- My Charizard data: data/onedata.json
